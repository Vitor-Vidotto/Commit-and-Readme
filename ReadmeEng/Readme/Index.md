## How it Works?
```
While exploring the topic of documentation, I decided to create my own
standardized documentation file. As you'll see here, I've divided the document 
into sections, such as components and pages. Each page includes the components it
uses, along with a link to the relevant component. This structure allows you to 
easily understand how each page and component works. However, please note that 
this is not a complete documentation—it's just a default template. Nonetheless, 
it has been incredibly helpful to me.
